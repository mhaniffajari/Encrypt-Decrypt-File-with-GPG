# Streamlit-Decrypt-Encrypt-File-with-GPG

This Streamlit app allows you to encrypt and decrypt CSV files, as well as generate encryption keys. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to securely manage file encryption and decryption with GPG. This streamlit can generate key pair for GPG encryption:

-**Public Key**: Used to encrypt data. This key can be shared freely with anyone who wants to send you encrypted data.

-**Private Key**: Used to decrypt data that was encrypted with your public key. This key must be kept secret, as itâ€™s essential for accessing the encrypted information.
